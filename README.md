# SIMULATION_APP
The Simulation App aims to create a realistic simulation of a petrochemical complex, allowing for testing, analysis, and optimization of operations. By integrating simulated data sources, a virtual model, and AI analytics, the app provides insights into process performance and potential improvements.
